# Heterodox Technology

Many people, who disagree on most things, agree that they need foundational
software technologies that they can reach into and change.


## Big Tech versus society

Already it has become difficult to do many things without using software of
some sort. Without it:

- You cannot communicate.
- You cannot publish.
- You cannot organise.
- You cannot keep records.
- You cannot buy specialist goods, such as dance shoes.
- You cannot have a bank account.
- You cannot pay your taxes.
- You cannot even watch TV.

The old ways of doing these things still work, of course, but they are
relatively terrible, and increasingly unfamiliar. It cannot be long before
computers will be necessary for buying essential food and clothes, paying
utililty bills, owning a house, and participating in politics.

Most people rely on software written by other people, and in particular by big
technology companies including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, and others. The
downside of such a small group of companies having so much influence is
obvious, and I don't need to rehearse it here. However, it is an efficient way
to serve the mass market, and I'm sure it will continue.

Most organisations need more control than that, and require custom software.
The same is true of many creative individuals, including researchers, artists
and entrepreneurs. Such software is written to serve only thousands of people,
or even fewer. Often this software must be written by a specialist programmer,
who is not an expert in whatever purpose the software is supposed to serve.
This disconnect, and the shortage of specialist programmers, is a significant
expense, and an obstacle.

The situation is comparable to the 18th century, in which most people could
not read and write, and relied heavily on the services of professional
scribes, priests, and each other. Many gave up any prospect of understanding
the world around them, of control over their lives, and of advancement in
society. Such people were vulnerable and generally oppressed. They were often
the victims of scams, and their lives were full of risk. Such a situation is
not healthy, and it is getting worse.

On current trends, most of us, if inactive, will eventually find ourselves
part of a digitally illiterate underclass. A 21st century person who cannot
use a computer will be like an 18th century person who cannot read, and a 21st
century person who cannot program will be like an 18th century person who
cannot write. This widespread illiteracy is not good for anybody. It's bad for
those who do become helpless; it's bad for those struggling not to be; and
it's bad for those who end up supporting everybody else.

The solution is not Luddism. The incipient computer revolution, like the
ongoing industrial revolution, is happening for good reasons, and will not
wait.

The solution is not the destruction of Big Tech, though we must at least
partially escape from reliance on software written by other people.

The solution is foundational technologies that people can reach into and
change.

Programming (or whatever it will be called in the future) needs to be reframed
as a basic literacy skill. Programming must be easy: children will need to
learn it at school. People must insist on surrounding themselves with whatever
programs they need to run their lives, including some that they write or
customise themselves. This will require new technology.

I dare not predict what programming will look like in twenty years. I do
predict, however, that the way ordinary people use computers will converge
with the way computers are programmed. The trend in that direction is already
clear. But the digital literacy deficit is not going to close automatically.
Somebody needs to invent the missing foundational technologies. It won't be
Big Tech.


## Heterogeneous motivations

We can learn from those who are already shunning mainstream technologies in
favour of software that they can more easily control. There are many such
people, and they have very little motivation in common.

- Computer science
- Digital archives
- Retro-computing
- Game engines
- Distributed computing
- Privacy
- Free software
- ...


## Homogeneous solutions

Studying the solutions people have come up with reveals many common elements.

[Each item becomes a subsection.]

- Virtual machine
- Programming language
- Platform
  - Standard libraries
  - Accelerators
  - User interfaces
  - Protocols
- Packaging
  - Distribution
  - Naming
  - Dependencies
  - Versions
- Key applications:
  - Messaging
  - Publishing
  - Apps
  - ...
- ...


## Proprosal

We write a bunch of adaptable foundational technologies, incorporating current
best practice.

It's almost always better to add an expert system to an existing programming
language than to add a programming language to an existing expert system. The
same goes for virtual machines, platforms, and package managers. We need to
make sure that the foundational technologies exist, such that experts can add
their systems to them.

### It doesn't have to be good

Heterodox technology always looks bad if it is evaluated as orthodox
technology, just as a hand-written notice looks bad next to a Hollywood
blockbuster. Rejecting heterodox technology for that reason is missing its
point. It doesn't need to be optimised for the mass market. It doesn't need to
be at the forefront of technology. It doesn't need to have tens of millions of
dollars spent on polish. It just needs to do its job, and to be easy to make.
