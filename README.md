# Collaborative goals

Sometimes it's useful to take a step back and think seriously about what we can
do to make the world a better place. This is especially important for those of
us who are more than half way through our lives.

This repo helps a small group of my friends to organise our software goals: to
motivate our projects and to give them context in a shared vision. We do not
expect to enforce on each other any kind of agenda; we opt in only for mutual
benefit.
